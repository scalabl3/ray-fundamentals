## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**Ray won't initialize:**
```python
# Check if already initialized
if not ray.is_initialized():
    ray.init()
```

**Import errors:**
```bash
pip install ray numpy psutil
```

**Tests timing out:**
- Reduce data sizes in examples
- Check available CPU/memory resources
- Ensure Ray Dashboard isn't blocking ports

**Memory errors:**
- Monitor system memory usage
- Reduce array sizes in examples
- Check for running Ray processes: `ray stop`

### Getting Help

1. **Ray Documentation**: https://docs.ray.io/
2. **Ray GitHub**: https://github.com/ray-project/ray
3. **Ray Discourse**: https://discuss.ray.io/
4. **Ray Dashboard**: http://localhost:8265 (when Ray is running)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmarks

When you run the test files, expect these approximate runtimes:
- **Fundamentals**: ~30 seconds
- **Advanced Tasks**: ~45 seconds  
- **Actors**: ~40 seconds
